Problem Statement :
Given an array of strings arr[] of length n representing non-negative integers, arrange them in a manner, such that, after 
concatanating them in order, it results in the largest possible number. Since the result may be very large, return it as a string.

Solution Code :
class Solution {
    String printLargest(int n, String[] arr) {
        // code here
        Arrays.sort(arr,
            (a,b) -> (a+b).compareTo(b+a)
        );
        StringBuilder sbr = new StringBuilder();
        for(int i = n-1; i>=0; i--){
            sbr.append(arr[i]);
        }
        return sbr.toString();
    }
}
