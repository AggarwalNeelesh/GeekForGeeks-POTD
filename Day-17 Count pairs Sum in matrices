Problem Statement :
Given two sorted matrices mat1 and mat2 of size n x n of elements. 
Each matrix contains numbers arranged in strictly ascending order, with each row sorted from left to right, and the last element of a row being smaller than 
the first element of the next row. 
You're given a target value, x, your task is to find and count all pairs {a, b} such that a is from mat1 and b is from mat2 where sum of a and b is equal to x.

Solution Code :
class Solution {
    int countPairs(int mat1[][], int mat2[][], int n, int x) {
        // code here
        int ct = 0;
        int i=0, j=0, p=n-1, q=n-1;
        while(i<=n-1 && p>=0){
            if(mat1[i][j]+mat2[p][q] == x){
                ct++;
                j++;
                q--;
            }
            else if(mat1[i][j]+mat2[p][q] > x)q--;
            else j++;
            
            if(j==n){
                i++;
                j=0;
            }
            if(q==-1){
                p--;
                q = n-1;
            }
        }
        return ct;
    }
}
