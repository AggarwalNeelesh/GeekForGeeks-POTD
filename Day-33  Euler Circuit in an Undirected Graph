Problem Statement :
Eulerian Path is a path in a graph that visits every edge exactly once. 
Eulerian Circuit is an Eulerian Path that starts and ends on the same vertex. Given the number of vertices v and adjacency list adj denoting the graph. 
Find that there exists the Euler circuit or not. Return 1 if there exist  alteast one eulerian path else 0.
Solution Code :
class Solution {
    public boolean isEularCircuitExist(int v, ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj) {
        // Code here
        //Property: A graph is said to have a Euler circuit if every vertex in graph has an even degree.
        
        for(ArrayList<Integer> a: adj)
            if(a.size()%2!=0) 
                return false;

        return true;
    }
}
